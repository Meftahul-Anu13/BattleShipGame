Battleship is a turn-based game wherein two
players strategically place their pieces on a 9 × 9 grid. Each player remains
unaware of their opponent’s piece placements, with each grid square capable
of accommodating only a single piece.The
game includes three types of pieces: a battleship, two destroyers, and three
submarines, which occupy 3, 2, and 1 grid squares respectively.A piece
is deemed destroyed once all grid squares it occupies have been hit. The
objective is to eliminate all of the opponent’s pieces to secure victory.
